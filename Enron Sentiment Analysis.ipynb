    "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a sentiment intensity tool added to NLTK in 2014. Unlike other techniques that require training on related text before use, VADER is ready to go for analysis without any special setup. VADER is unique in that it makes fine-tuned distinctions between varying degrees of positivity and negativity. For example, VADER scores “comfort” moderately positively and “euphoria” extremely positively. It also attempts to capture and score textual features common in informal online text such as capitalizations, exclamation points, and emoticon."
